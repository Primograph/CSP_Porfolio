            <p>Throughout the school year, there have been numerous guest speakers for my Computer Science Principles class. Two of the guest speakers have stayed with me. They were Alan Borecky and Aileen Iniguez.</p>

            <p>Alan Borkecky was the first guest speaker of the year and talked about game design and project/company start-ups. For about the first half, he talked about game design and the process that games go through. He mentioned the people who play the game in its developmental stages to find bugs and other problems, stating how most people think it is fun because you get to play videogames but is, in reality, boring due to the constant replaying of the same thing. For the rest of the talk, he went over project/company start-ups. He explained that he was the software engineer for a start-up and explained what this role meant and what he had to do. This interested me because I want to become a software engineer so it was useful to hear what he said about the area and his job.</p>

            <p>Aileen Iniguez came from Chevron to talk to us about the programming side of the company and her part in it. For the first half of the talk, she explained how the programming side of the company had almost no relations with the selling of gas. She explained that she calculated the likelihood of prices rising and other statistics. She also mentioned that she had to work with a lot of graphing and modeling software. This interests me because I want to learn if there are similarities with python and how compatible modeling is with it.</p>
