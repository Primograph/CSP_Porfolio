            <p>Durring my time in the engineering program, I have met many industry proffessionals through field trips. The field trips were to a water processing plant, and to the Lawernce Livermore National Labratory.</p>

            <p>The first field trip I went on was to the water treatment plant. Due to Covid-19, it was a virtual tour of the plant. We started with a qucik explanation of how long our guides have been working there, and a presentation about what goes on at the plant. After we got a tour of the plant, and were shown the water basins, the filters, the pumps, as well as some other locations. It was very interesting to learn about how the water is filtered and cleaned. We were also told that, since they have to clean the filters, they find a  lot of unexpected stuff, such as a lot of phones. This was very interesting to me because I never thought that there was so much to do to the water. I origonally thought that all you had to do was filter and it was done. Going on this field trip showed me that there is a lot more to it other than filtering, like making sure it is clean and safe, etc.</p>

            <p>The second field trip was to the Lawerence Livermore National Labratories (LLNL). The field trip started with short introductions. We then moved to breakout rooms, where three employees talked to us about specific aspects of the facility. One such aspect was the huge building devoted only to the computers. The building had its own cooling system that could pump an insane amount of air in seconds. After the breakout rooms, there was a panel discussion. The panelists talked about their expireience at LLNL. At the end, we had a tour of the facility, showing a large mechanism that generates a a laser, then greatly increases its strength, before condensiing the beam down into a small square. The beam is then changed to vissable light, then to ultraviolet light, then being focused into a small container and condensing a small pellet, causing it to explode. The explosion takes place in a large spherical container, with a lot of precautions to prevent radiation from escaping too far out. It was very interesting because they were able to condence and empower a beam into a square shape, and then use it to explode and compress a pellet. </p>

            <p>Throughout my freshman year, there were numerous guest speakers for my Computer Science Principles class. Two of the guest speakers have stayed with me. They were Alan Borecky and Aileen Iniguez.</p>

            <p>Alan Borkecky was the first guest speaker of the year and talked about game design and project/company start-ups. For about the first half, he talked about game design and the process that games go through. He mentioned the people who play the game in its developmental stages to find bugs and other problems, stating how most people think it is fun because you get to play videogames but is, in reality, boring due to the constant replaying of the same thing. For the rest of the talk, he went over project/company start-ups. He explained that he was the software engineer for a start-up and explained what this role meant and what he had to do. This interested me because I want to become a software engineer so it was useful to hear what he said about the area and his job.</p>

            <p>Aileen Iniguez came from Chevron to talk to us about the programming side of the company and her part in it. For the first half of the talk, she explained how the programming side of the company had almost no relations with the selling of gas. She explained that she calculated the likelihood of prices rising and other statistics. She also mentioned that she had to work with a lot of graphing and modeling software. This interests me because I want to learn if there are similarities with python and how compatible modeling is with it.</p>
