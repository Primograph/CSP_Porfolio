            <p>Durring my time in the engineering program, I have met many industry proffessionals through field trips. The field trips were to a water processing plant, and to the Lawernce Livermore National Labratory.</p>

            <p>The first field trip I went on was to the water treatment plant. Due to Covid-19, it was a virtual tour of the plant. We started with a qucik explanation of how long our guides have been working there, and a presentation about what goes on at the plant. After we got a tour of the plant, and were shown the water basins, the filters, the pumps, as well as some other locations. It was very interesting to learn about how the water is filtered and cleaned. We were also told that, since they have to clean the filters, they find a  lot of unexpected stuff, such as a lot of phones. This was very interesting to me because I never thought that there was so much to do to the water. I origonally thought that all you had to do was filter and it was done. Going on this field trip showed me that there is a lot more to it other than filtering, like making sure it is clean and safe, etc.</p>

            <p>The second field trip was to the Lawerence Livermore National Labratories (LLNL). The field trip started with short introductions. We then moved to breakout rooms, where three employees talked to us about specific aspects of the facility. One such aspect was the huge building devoted only to the computers. The building had its own cooling system that could pump an insane amount of air in seconds. After the breakout rooms, there was a panel discussion. The panelists talked about their expireience at LLNL. At the end, we had a tour of the facility, showing a large mechanism that generates a a laser, then greatly increases its strength, before condensiing the beam down into a small square. The beam is then changed to vissable light, then to ultraviolet light, then being focused into a small container and condensing a small pellet, causing it to explode. The explosion takes place in a large spherical container, with a lot of precautions to prevent radiation from escaping too far out. It was very interesting because they were able to condence and empower a beam into a square shape, and then use it to explode and compress a pellet. </p>

            <p>More recently, I had the opportunity to tour the Clorox test laboratory. The visit started with brief introductions, where we met our tour guides and talked a bit about the company. The first stop showed off where the cleaning solution found in Clorox Bleach and other cleaning products was created and tested. We were also shown the machine that rolls up the wipes in the Clorox wipes. They also described how and why they chose the materials and packaging for the wipes, explaining factors like costs and marketing. The rest of the tour focused on other products owned by the Clorox Company, and the testing that was behind them. We learned that Clorox was behind a wide range of products, ranging from Hidden Valley ranch to Britta water filters and Kingsford charcoal. We were shown some of the tests behind a lot of these products, such as where they conducted water filter tests using robots, and where they burned the coal to test quality. The two final stops of the tour were where they tested their stain removal formulas, which involved a technique where they could apply any sort of common stain to a piece of clothing, then analyze what happens to the stain when washed. The final room was a long hallway with toilets lining the walls, which was where they experimented with their toilet-cleaning formulas. The tour ended with a sort of “meet and greet’ with a couple of their engineers. Through this, we learned about why they chose to work at Clorox, what was their career path, and what was their education path like, and also given the opportunity to ask them questions. </p>

            <p>Another recent field trip I went on was to Dig Deep Farms in San Leandro. We got a tour of the grounds and were given the opportunity to learn about sustainable and green farming practices. We were taught about how overturning the earth actually contributes to the greenhouse gases in the air, and how they have worked to minimize the number of times they overturn their soil, preferring to use natural methods like earthworms. Afterward, we visited the greenhouses, where they showed us the plants they had growing there, and explained how they worked. There was also an explanation of side effects caused by the greenhouses, as the plants grown there are sheltered from the elements, making them more susceptible to elements like disease or strong winds. To help combat this, before planting into the ground, the plants are held in pots by the greenhouse, allowing them to acclimate to the climate. We also learned about the three sisters, a combination of crops that benefit earth other. These are corn, beans, and squash: the beans fertilize the soil for the corn and squash, while the corn in turn provides support for the beans, and the squash provides ground cover that helps prevent weeds from growing. The second to last stop of our tour was the animal pens, where they raised some pigs and goats. They were fed by the watermelons produced by our final stop, a large field filled with peppers, okra, beans, and watermelon </p>

            <p>Throughout my freshman year, there were numerous guest speakers for my Computer Science Principles class. Two of the guest speakers have stayed with me. They were Alan Borecky and Aileen Iniguez.</p>

            <p>Alan Borkecky was the first guest speaker of the year and talked about game design and project/company start-ups. For about the first half, he talked about game design and the process that games go through. He mentioned the people who play the game in its developmental stages to find bugs and other problems, stating how most people think it is fun because you get to play videogames but is, in reality, boring due to the constant replaying of the same thing. For the rest of the talk, he went over project/company start-ups. He explained that he was the software engineer for a start-up and explained what this role meant and what he had to do. This interested me because I want to become a software engineer so it was useful to hear what he said about the area and his job.</p>

            <p>Aileen Iniguez came from Chevron to talk to us about the programming side of the company and her part in it. For the first half of the talk, she explained how the programming side of the company had almost no relations with the selling of gas. She explained that she calculated the likelihood of prices rising and other statistics. She also mentioned that she had to work with a lot of graphing and modeling software. This interests me because I want to learn if there are similarities with python and how compatible modeling is with it.</p>

            <p>Gary Richter worked for Sandia National Labs as an international security analyst and had come to talk to us about his path and career. He explained how his goal was to counter terrorism and terrorist interest in weapons of mass destruction, and what it actually meant to be a systems analyst. He used buying a car as an example, describing how a system analyst would look at the car's visual appearance, its power, the number of passengers, and so on. When out in the field, he and his team would be the first ones into a terrorist’s hideout, in order to investigate and take samples. He also talked a bit about the control of nuclear weapons. There are a variety of factors and materials that go into the making of a nuclear bomb, such as the isotope of uranium or plutonium.</p>

            <p>Donald James worked for NASA and came to talk to us about his work at NASA, as well as the life skills he learned along the way. The talk began with him describing some of the stuff he worked on there. He explained that some of his main missions were focused on some of his main missions, which were the International Space Station, the space launch system, the rover on Mars, and the James Webb telescope. The second half of the talk focused more on the important skills he learned. The first one was perseverance. He explained that regardless of what gets you down or sets you back, it is important that you pick yourself up and try again. One of his other major key points was that manners are extremely important. He explains that in all interviews, and professional interactions, people would be judging you, so it is important to be kind, organized, and so on.</p>

            <p>Finally, during the Mentorship Program, I was mentored by Shawn Mehaffey, who had worked for Chevron as a data analyst. Throughout the program, we learned valuable life skills, such as how to set goals that were realistic and attainable. We were also given a variety of opportunities to explore possible career paths, and education paths, as well as practice important life skills like networking, elevator speeches, and interviews.</p>
