            <p>My name is Nathan Kantorov and I am a freshman at Dublin High School. When I grow up I aim to become a computer programmer. This career interests me because I enjoy coding a program that will translate to and from Morse Code or alter and print a list. I am fluent in English and can read and speak basic Russian and Spanish, so I find learning programming languages are similar to learning a spoken language.
            </p><p>
            Some traits and characteristics that I have that are related to this field are patience and reliability. I am patient because I can wait a couple of hours for something before asking for it. This is useful when it comes to working on large programming projects where more than one person is working on different parts. I have shown this trait while working on various group projects while waiting for my partners to finish their part so I could work on mine. I am reliable because if told to do something and have it done by a specific time, I will be able to do it. This is useful for deadlines and I have shown this in numerous projects which contained a deadline before the final product was due, such as the App Inventor project, which had a deadline on September 30, 2019. I have also been a part of the Robotics team for my old school, Quarry Lane.
            </p><p>
            I have learned that given the situation, I can be creative. I have noticed that as I look at things, such as a type of style of building, that I like, I would try to find a way to incorporate it into things I like to do. Some of these are activities are writing, reading, drawing, and building in Minecraft. I also like to travel which helps to inspire me.

            Thank you for reading my About Me page, and I hope you enjoy the rest of my online portfolio.</p>
