            <p>My name is Nathan Kantorov, and I am currently a senior at Dublin High School. Ever since I was young, I have always gravitated toward computer science, which eventually resulted in a lot of little side projects and challenges I completed with my Dad. The moment I was able to, I began taking computer science and programming classes at school. My interest in computer science has only grown, and as a result, I plan on completing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
            </p><p>
            I have always been a kind and caring person, as I am always willing to help those who ask, even if all I can do is just be there and listen. I am flexible, as I know that everyone has their own life to deal with, and sometimes things that we have no control over happen. I am also relatively versatile, as I know a couple of different programming languages, such as Python, Java, and HTML.
            </p><p>
            Outside of school, I have a decent amount of experience with programming, mostly in the form of projects I completed with my Dad and brother. These projects tended to vary in difficulty, ranging from simple challenges to more complex activities. One of my favorite projects is the one where we recreated a card game in Python, making it so that you could play against an AI, or have two AI strategies play each other. Additionally, over the summer after my junior year, I participated in two summer camps: the Pre-College Scholars 2-week track at UC Berkeley and Engineering Possibilities In College (EPIC) at California Polytechnic San Louis Obispo. The event at UC Berkeley was incredibly informative, as it provide a lot of in-depth knowledge regarding what classes would be like in college, while simultaneously teaching us about various advanced programming techniques. On the other hand, EPIC was a bit broader and provided insight into other fields of engineering that I had originally never really considered such as civil and electrical engineering.
