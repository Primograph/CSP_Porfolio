            <h6>Project Name: 2.3.4 Find the Exploits</h6>
            <h6>Course: Cybersecurity</h6>
            <h6>Duration: 1 week (February 2, 2023 - February 9, 2023)</h6>
            <h6>Objective: To find the exploits in a website using penetration testing</h6>
            <h6>Type of Project: Group Project</h6>
            <br>
            <p>In this project we had to first undergo a quick training exercise and then conduct a penetration test on a website. First we got into our teams and came up with a plan and some team norms. We then started our individual emulations of the situation. We began with the training exercise, the goal of which was to be able to recognize two new attacks. These attacks are an XSS Stored attack and a Command Execution attack. Afterwards we then had to conduct some penetration testing on a website. This consisted of utilizing applications like Wireshark and going through the code of the website. </p>

            <h6>Project Name: 1.3.1 A Dangerous Situation</h6>
            <h6>Course: Cybersecurity</h6>
            <h6>Duration: 1 week (November 1, 2022 - November 7, 2022)</h6>
            <h6>Objective: To find and correct all the security issues</h6>
            <h6>Type of Project: Group Project</h6>
            <br>
            <p>In this project we had to respond and recover from a cyberattack. As a team, we first came up with a plan and set of team norms. Then individually we started an emulation of the situation. One of the first steps I took was scanning all the files on the computer to find and remove any suspicious/malicious files. The next step was to  check the firewall inbound and outbound rules, updating them if necessary. After that there are some other small tasks, such as checking the trash and downloads folders. Once completing the lab we had to fill out a Security Incident Response Report. The report contained details such as what might be the cause of the breach, what are some ways to prevent future breaches and to provide examples, like changing passwords every 90 days and so on. </p>

            <h6>Objective: To create a class seating chart in Greenfoot, and to practice using GitHub</h6>
            <h6>Type of Project: Group Project</h6>
            <br>
            <p>For the duration of this project, I was responsible for programing an animation for myself, recording a short greeting for myself, adding a picture of myself. The rest of the class were responsible for the same thiing. Some people had the extra responsibility of helping everyone upload everything to GitHub. We were provided with some insturctions, a GitHub repository, and a template/example for the requirments. There were some difficulties when everyo0ne was trying to push to GitHub, because some of us downloaded from the wrong repository, or forgot to make a copy of the correct repository. </p>

            <h6>Project Name: Flappy Bird</h6>
            <h6>Course: AP Computer Science Applications (AP CSA)</h6>
            <h6>Duration:  About 3 weeks (June 22, 2021 - July 12, 2021)</h6>
            <h6>Objective: To find a premade game on the Greenfoot website, and add our own changes/updates.</h6>
            <h6>Type of Project: Group Project</h6>
            <br>
            <p>My group chose to work on the Flappy Bird game. We were all responsible for programming and working on a presentation, which served as the documentation for the project. My friend and I acted as the group leaders, delegating work and trying to schedule Zoom meetings so that we could all discuss or ask each other questions. We were quite ambitious with what we wanted to change as we planned on adding new sound effects, background music, a main menu, how to play menu, and a menu that allowed you to switch what your character looked like. Additionally, since this project was technically done over the summer, we had some additional difficulties in trying to communicate and share all the files with each other. </p>

            <h6>Project Name: Upcycling Project</h6>
            <h6>Course: Principles of Engineering (POE)</h6>
            <h6>Duration: About 4 weeks (Feburary 11, 2021 - March 8, 2021)</h6>
            <h6>Objective: To create a line of products that use/incorporate recycled materials.</h6>
            <h6>Type of Project: Group Project</h6>
            <br>
            <p>For the duration of this project, I was responsible for one of three products, documenting my work, finalizing the slide deck, and recording my part of the video. My partners were responsible for their documentation, products, parts of the video, and the slides. We were provided with a document that explained the requirements for the products, as well as some guidelines for what we need to have by the end of the project. There were some difficulties when making the motor, such as having the perfect amount of coils is key, so that it creates a strong enough elctromagnet while also not being too heavy. One other difficulty was lack of materials, as the type of magnet used to spin the coil should be as strong as possible (within reason when compared to the size of the motor). While I was building I found that, depending on the type of motor, there must be a good amount of current, coils, a strong magnet (perferably neodymium), and 18 gauge copper wire to make a working motor.</p>

            <h6>Duration: About 5 weeks (March 18, 2021 - April 16, 2021)</h6>
            <h6>Objective: To create a cheap bridge that crosses a gorge and is at least 12m from the bottom.</h6>
            <h6>Type of Project: Group Project</h6>
            <br>
            <p>For the duration of this project, I was responsible for 2 sketches and some designs in the simulator for the descision matrix, as well as documentation and slides. My partners were responsible for their documentation, designs, sketches, and the slides. We were provided with a document that explained the requirements for the bridge, as well as some guidelines for what we need to have by the end of the project. We managed to make a pretty cheap bridge by making it out of hollow carbon steal, a keeping it as low as possible. We also managed to descrease the amount of money by using a muscle truss, allwoingus to support the majority of the bridge with less members.</p>

            <h6>Type of Project: Group Project</h6>
            <br>
            <p>For this project, I was responsible for the code. My partner was responsible for the documentation, however, we both worked on the coding and the documentation. We were provided with a document that contained the criteria for both options and some questions for when we finished coding the game or story. While coding our project, (we chose to do a story) we found that all the timings had to be near exact otherwise everything that followed would be off. We also found out that it is better to use fewer sprites and broadcasts to prevent and/or lessen lag.</p>

            <p>For the duration of this project, I was responsible for the code. My partner was responsible for the documentation, however, we both worked on the coding and documentation. We were provided with a document that explained the requirements for the app as well as some conclusion questions. There were some difficulties when we were coding. One such difficulty was when my partner was unsure where something was so I had to guide him over the phone. While we were programming I found that, depending on the settings, if you were to turn the device the app was running on, you could break your app.</p>
