            <h4>Upcycling Project</h4>
            <h6>Project Name: Upcycling Project</h6>
            <h6>Course: Principles of Engineering (POE)</h6>
            <h6>Duration: About 4 weeks (Feburary 11, 2021 - March 8, 2021)</h6>
            <h6>Objective: To create a line of products that use/incorporate recycled materials.</h6>
            <h6>Type of Project: Group Project</h6>
            <br>
            <p>For the duration of this project, I was responsible for one of three products, documenting my work, finalizing the slide deck, and recording my part of the video. My partners were responsible for their documentation, products, parts of the video, and the slides. We were provided with a document that explained the requirements for the products, as well as some guidelines for what we need to have by the end of the project. There were some difficulties when making the motor, such as having the perfect amount of coils is key, so that it creates a strong enough elctromagnet while also not being too heavy. One other difficulty was lack of materials, as the type of magnet used to spin the coil should be as strong as possible (within reason when compared to the size of the motor). While I was building I found that, depending on the type of motor, there must be a good amount of current, coils, a strong magnet (perferably neodymium), and 18 gauge copper wire to make a working motor.</p>

            <h4>Bridge Project</h4>
            <h6>Project Name: Bridge Project</h6>
            <h6>Course: Principles of Engineering (POE)</h6>
            <h6>Duration: About 5 weeks (March 18, 2021 - April 16, 2021)</h6>
            <h6>Objective: To create a cheap bridge that crosses a gorge and is at least 12m from the bottom.</h6>
            <h6>Type of Project: Group Project</h6>
            <br>
            <p>For the duration of this project, I was responsible for 2 sketches and some designs in the simulator for the descision matrix, as well as documentation and slides. My partners were responsible for their documentation, designs, sketches, and the slides. We were provided with a document that explained the requirements for the bridge, as well as some guidelines for what we need to have by the end of the project. We managed to make a pretty cheap bridge by making it out of hollow carbon steal, a keeping it as low as possible. We also managed to descrease the amount of money by using a muscle truss, allwoingus to support the majority of the bridge with less members.</p>

            <h4>Scratch Project</h4>
            <h6>Project Name: A Small Story</h6>
            <h6>Course: Computer Science Priniciples (CSP)</h6>
            <h6>Duration: About a week (September 3, 2019 - September 11, 2019)</h6>
            <h6>Objective: To code either a pick your own adventure or some type of game in Scratch</h6>
            <h6>Type of Project: Group Project</h6>
            <br>
            <p>For this project, I was responsible for the code. My partner was responsible for the documentation, however, we both worked on the coding and the documentation. We were provided with a document that contained the criteria for both options and some questions for when we finished coding the game or story. While coding our project, (we chose to do a story) we found that all the timings had to be near exact otherwise everything that followed would be off. We also found out that it is better to use fewer sprites and broadcasts to prevent and/or lessen lag.</p>

            <h6>Course: Computer Science Priniciples (CSP)</h6>
            <h6>Duration: About 3 weeks (September 23, 2019 - October 9, 2019)</h6>
            <h6>Objective: To create an app using App Inventor either based off of a tutorial or one of your own ideas</h6>
            <h6>Type of Project: Group Project</h6>
            <br>
            <p>For the duration of this project, I was responsible for the code. My partner was responsible for the documentation, however, we both worked on the coding and documentation. We were provided with a document that explained the requirements for the app as well as some conclusion questions. There were some difficulties when we were coding. One such difficulty was when my partner was unsure where something was so I had to guide him over the phone. While we were programming I found that, depending on the settings, if you were to turn the device the app was running on, you could break your app.</p>
