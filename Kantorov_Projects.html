            <h6>Project Name: A Small Story</h6>
            <h6>Course: Computer Science Priniciples (CSP)</h6>
            <h6>Duration: About a week (September 3, 2019 - September 11, 2019)</h6>
            <h6>Objective: To code either a pick your own adventure or some type of game in Scratch</h6>
            <h6>Type of Project: Group Project</h6>
            <br>
            <p>For this project, I was responsible for the code. My partner was responsible for the documentation, however, we both worked on the coding and the documentation. We were provided with a document that contained the criteria for both options and some questions for when we finished coding the game or story. While coding our project, (we chose to do a story) we found that all the timings had to be near exact otherwise everything that followed would be off. We also found out that it is better to use fewer sprites and broadcasts to prevent and/or lessen lag.</p>

            <h4>App Inventor Project</h4>
            <h6>Project Name: Mini Golf</h6>
            <h6>Course: Computer Science Priniciples (CSP)</h6>
            <h6>Duration: About 3 weeks (September 23, 2019 - October 9, 2019)</h6>
            <h6>Objective: To create an app using App Inventor either based off of a tutorial or one of your own ideas</h6>
            <h6>Type of Project: Group Project</h6>
            <br>
            <p>For the duration of this project, I was responsible for he code. My partner was responsible for the documentation, however, we both worked on the coding and documentation. We were provided with a document that explained the requirements for the app as well as some conclusion questions. There were some difficulties when we were coding. One such difficulty was when my partner was unsure where something was so I had to guide him over the phone. While we were programming I found that, depending on the settings, if you were to turn the device the app was running on, you could break your app.</p>
